Using Tkinter create a calculator having following appearance and
functionalities.
Functionalities to include:
1. Calculator should support basic operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division.
2. User should be able to type number (containing any number of
digits) in the text area.
3. When user clicks on any operator button, contents from text
area should get cleared so that user can enter second number
(containing any number of digits).
4. When user clicks on ‘=’ button result of operation should be
displayed in text area. Any contents from text area should be
cleared before displaying the result.
5. Clicking on clear button should clear the contents from text area.
6. Add suitable icon and title for the application window.

### Assignment 13
```
Create a dataframe having following columns:
• ISBN (unique number for each book)
• Title
• Author
• Publication
• Year Published
• Price
• Copies sold of first edition
• Copies sold in second edition
• Copies sold in third edition
You can use any of the studied approach to create dataframe. Add
minimum 10 records to the dataframe. Perform following
operations on dataframe using appropriate functions:
1. Display the number of rows and columns in dataframe
2. Give the descriptive statistics of the created dataset.
3. Display distinct publication names for the dataset.
4. Display the book title and author names published by “Metro
Publication”
5. Rename columns “Copies sold in first edition”, “Copies sold in
second edition” and “Copies sold in third edition”to FE, SE and
TE respectively
6. Add a column “Average sale” to your dataframe derived as
(average of FE, SE and TE) * Price.

Using scipy library, perform following linear algebraic operations:
1. Solve the system of linear equations:
a. 9x + 6y – 5z + 2w = 17
b. 4x + 5y – 7z + 3w = 10
c. -3x - 4y + 2z - 5w = 20
d. 6x + y + 9z - w = 23
2. Perform the following operations on a matrix
𝐴 = [
5 3 2
6 9 −3
1 7 4
]
a. Find Inverse of matrix A.
b. Find Kronecker product of A with B= [
3 −1
2 −5
]
c. Find determinant of matrix A
```

### Assignment 15
```
1: Create a web application using Flask to display the Books
available in the library when the ‘books’ endpoint is visited. For
each book, display ISBN number, Book title, Author and publication.
Also facilitate the search of book by ISBN number. For this the ISBN
number should be passed as parameter and the details of only that
book will be displayed. (Use GET, render template, redirect,
jsonify methods).

2:Create a web app using Flask to display the result of a user. If
marks are less than 50, redirect user to the ‘failed’ web page and
display the appropriate result. Otherwise, redirect user to ‘passed’
web page and display the appropriate result on that page. (Use
redirect, jsonify and other methods as needed).
