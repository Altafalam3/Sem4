1: Create a web application using Flask to display the Books
available in the library when the ‘books’ endpoint is visited. For
each book, display ISBN number, Book title, Author and publication.
Also facilitate the search of book by ISBN number. For this the ISBN
number should be passed as parameter and the details of only that
book will be displayed. (Use GET, render template, redirect,
jsonify methods).

marks are less than 50, redirect user to the ‘failed’ web page and
display the appropriate result. Otherwise, redirect user to ‘passed’

redirect, jsonify and other methods as needed).
